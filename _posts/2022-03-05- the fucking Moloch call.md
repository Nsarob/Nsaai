you read the famous Allen Gensberg's poem on Moloch [link] {https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/}
 
 The implicit question is; if everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it?
 ### And Ginsberg answers: 
                          Moloch.
 
 
 It’s powerful not because it’s correct – nobody literally thinks an ancient Carthaginian demon causes everything but because
 thinking of the system as an agent throws into relief the degree to which the system isn’t an agent.Bostrom makes an offhanded 
 reference of the possibility of a dictatorless dystopia, one that every single citizen including the leadership hates but which 
 nevertheless endures unconquered. 
 
 
 
 It’s easy enough to imagine such a state- Imagine a country with two rules: first, every person must spend eight hours a day giving 
 themselves strong electric shocks. Second, if anyone fails to follow a rule (including this one), or speaks out against it,
 or fails to enforce it, all citizens must unite to kill that person. Suppose these rules were well-enough established by tradition
 that everyone expected them to be enforced.

So you shock yourself for eight hours a day, because you know if you don’t everyone else will kill you, because if they don’t, everyone
else will kill them, and so on. Every single citizen hates the system, but for lack of a good coordination mechanism it endures. 
From a god’s-eye-view, we can optimize the system to “everyone agrees to stop doing this at once”, but no one within the system is able 
to effect the transition without great risk to themselves.

### Real world examples of similar multipolar traps to really hammer in how important this is


## 1. The Prisoner’s Dilemma
coordination is hard From a god’s-eye-view, we can agree that cooperate-cooperate is a better outcome than defect-defect, but neither prisoner within the system can make it happen.

 ## 2. Dollar auctions 
 Using some weird auction rules, you can take advantage of poor coordination to make someone pay $10 for a one dollar bill. From a god’s-eye-view, clearly people should not pay $10 for a on-er.
 
## 3. The fish farming story

## 4. The Malthusian trap
